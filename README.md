### 5 steps to a technical question

1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity

    Design an algorithm to sort a list
    - What sort of list? An array? A linked list? Array
    - What does the array hold? Numbers? Characters? Strings? Numbers
    - Are the numbers integers? Yes
    - Where did the numbers come from? Are they IDs? Values? They are the ages of customers
    - How many customers are there? A million

2. Design an algorithm

    Always ask yourself the following:
    - What is the space and time complexity?
    - What happens if there is a lot of data?
    - Does your design cause other issues?
    - If there are other issues, did you make the right trade-offs?
    - If they gave you specific data, have you leveraged that information?

3. Write pseudocode first and tell interviewer you’re writing pseudocode, but make sure you tell your interviewer that you’ll eventually write real code

4. Write your code at a moderate pace

5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes

    - Extreme cases: 0, negative, null, maximums, minimums
    - Use error: What happens if the user passes in null or a negative value?
    - General cases: Test the normal case
    - Don’t randomly trial and error to fix mistakes

### Tips

Use data structures generously

Write modular code using multiple functions

Write code that solves the general case instead of specific if not too complex

ex: solving NxN tic-tac-toe board instead of 3x3

Validate the inputs, say you would write the checks

-ex: if statements
