"""
A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.

They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

Two rectangles overlapping a little. It must be love.
Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

They are defined as dictionaries â†´ like this:

  my_rectangle = {

    # Coordinates of bottom-left corner
    'left_x'   : 1,
    'bottom_y' : 1,

    # Width and height
    'width'    : 6,
    'height'   : 3,

}

Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
